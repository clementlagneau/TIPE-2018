# TIPE-2018

Academic project.

This project is to transform an inhomogeneous image database to a homogeneous images database. That can be apply for share images of all types like products or landscapes. Firstly, I choosed characteristics to characterized pictures in images database by using image processing. Secondly, I do this for all the images in the database and I do an average of all characteristics. Thirdly, I used digital filtering to make them all have the same average. I allow remove images if they are to distinct. Finally, I have a homogeneous image database.
